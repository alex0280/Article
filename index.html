    <h3>Preventive Measures</h3>
    <p>
      Experts and government authorities suggest several steps to reduce the frequency and severity of car accidents:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strict Enforcement of Traffic Laws:</strong> Targeting over-speeding and drunk driving.</li>
      <li><strong>Public Awareness Campaigns:</strong> Educating the public about road safety and responsible driving.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved Infrastructure:</strong> Building better roads with adequate lighting and signage.</li>
      <li><strong>Vehicle Safety Standards:</strong> Encouraging the use of vehicles with airbags, ABS, and other safety features.</li>
      <li><strong>Driver Education:</strong> Mandatory training and tests to ensure road safety awareness among drivers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As the number of vehicles on Indiaâ€™s roads continues to grow, it becomes increasingly critical for the government and citizens alike to adopt proactive measures that enhance road safety.
      By implementing stricter laws, raising public awareness, and investing in infrastructure, India can reduce the toll of car accidents and save countless lives.
